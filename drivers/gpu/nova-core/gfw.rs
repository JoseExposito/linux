//! A clarification about devinit terminology: devinit is a sequence of register read/writes after
//! reset that performs tasks such as:
//! 1. Programming VRAM memory controller timings.
//! 2. Power sequencing.
//! 3. Clock and PLL configuration.
//! 4. Thermal management.

//! devinit itself is a 'script' which is interpreted by an interpreter program typically running
//! on the PMU microcontroller.

//! Note that the devinit sequence also needs to run during suspend/resume.

/// Upon GPU reset, several microcontrollers (such as PMU, SEC2, GSP etc) run some firmware code to
/// setup its core parameters. Most of the GPU is considered unusable until this step is completed,
/// so it must be waited on very early during driver initialization.
///
/// The `GFW` code includes several components that need to execute before the driver loads. These
/// components are located in the VBIOS ROM and executed in a sequence on these different
/// microcontrollers. The devinit sequence typically runs on the PMU, and the FWSEC runs on the
/// GSP.
///
/// This function waits for a signal indicating that core initialization is complete. Before this
/// signal is received, little can be done with the GPU. This signal is set by the FWSEC running on
/// the GSP in Heavy-secured mode.
